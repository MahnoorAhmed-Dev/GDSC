        <h1>THE ART OF WAR 兵法</h1>
        <h2>BY SUN TZU</h2>
        <h3>INTRODUCTION <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War" target="_blank"> <img src="Bamboo Book.jpg" 
            alt="This is a book named The Art Of War By Sun Tzu" height="100" width="100"></a></h3>

            <p>Sun Tzu's <i>The Art Of War</i> is probably the earliest-known 
            treaties on war and military science. It is certainly the most
            influential. Essential reading for strategists in East since ancient
            times, it is thought that Napolean read <i>The Art Of War</i> 
            when a new edition was published in Paris in 1782.</p> 
            
            <p>It was also picked up by two great military theorists who studied Bonaparte's 
            methods-the Prussian Carl Von Clausewitz, whose <i>On War</i> was published 
            posthumously in 1832, and the French General Baron Antoine-Henri de Jomini, 
            whose <i>Summary Of The War</i> appeared in 1838. Also influenced were the 
            pre- Second World War theorists of tank warfare General John Fuller and 
            B.H. Liddell Hart - and, consequently, the German Panzer leaders, 
            including Heinz Guderian, who devoured their work. Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, 
            victor of El Alamein and commander of land forces on D-Day, wrote extensively on 
            <i>The Art of War</i> in his monumental <i>A History of Warfare</i> His great rival, 
            General George Patton, is thought to have read Sun Tzu as a teenager in the 
            <i>Virginia Military Institute</i> before he went to West Point.</p>

            <p> General Douglas MacArthur and Joseph Stalin were also said to have been fans of Sun Tzu. 
            <i>The Art of War</i> was adopted as a handbook on guerrilla warfare by Mao Zedong, 
            Fidel Castro and Vo Nguyen Giap, the Vietnamese strategist who beat the French and 
            the Americans in Indo-China, and according to US Marine Corps General Paul K. Van Riper, 
            it influenced the planning of Operation Desert Storm.</p>
